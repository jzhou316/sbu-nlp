        Natural Language Processing (NLP) group at Stony Brook University is a team of researchers working on developing and studying state-of-the-art machine learning and computational methods for generating, analyzing and understanding language.
        Areas that we have particular strengths in include:
        - Human Centered NLP with applications to real world consequential tasks such as HealthCare, Writing Assistance
        - Evaluation of NLP technologies, resources, and human language use
        - Natural Language Generation
        - Efficiency in Model Algorithms, Training, and Inference
        - Morphology
        - Syntax and Semantics
        - Linguistic theories, Cognitive Modeling and Psycholinguistics
        - Dialogue, spoken language
