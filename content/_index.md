        Welcome to the Natural Language Processing (NLP) group at Stony Brook University. We are a team of researchers dedicated to developing and studying cutting-edge machine learning and computational methods for generating, analyzing, and understanding language.

        In the era of large language models (LLMs) and rapidly advancing artificial intelligence (AI), our work is at the forefront of the field. We focus on both in-depth and broad research to understand, improve, evaluate, and democratize the advanced technologies stemming from traditional and modern NLP.

        Our group's areas of expertise and active research include:
        - Language models (e.g., interpretability, development, architecture)
        - Natural language generation
        - Model efficiency (e.g., training/inference algorithms, hardware- and system-aware efficiency)
        - Evaluation of NLP technologies and human language use
        - Advanced LLM reasoning
        - Multimodal AI (e.g., vision-language models)
        - Agentic frameworks and benchmarks
        - Human-AI alignment and collaboration
        - Impact of generative AI
        - The fundamentals of language, including morphology, syntax, and semantics
        - Linguistic theories, Cognitive Modeling, and Psycholinguistics
        - Dialogue and spoken language
