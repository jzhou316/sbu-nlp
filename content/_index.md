        Natural Language Processing (NLP) group at Stony Brook University is a team of researchers working on developing and studying state-of-the-art machine learning and computational methods for generating, analyzing and understanding language. Areas that we have particular strengths in include:

    - Human Centered NLP with applications to real world consequential tasks such as HealthCare, Writing Assistance
    - Evaluation of NLP technologies, resources, and human language use
    - Natural Language Generation
    - Efficiency in Model Algorithms, Training, and Inference
    - Morphology
    - Syntax and Semantics
    - Linguistic theories, Cognitive Modeling and Psycholinguistics
    - Dialogue, spoken language
