interests:
  - I am working to improve the reasoning capabilities of LLMs to understand scientific text. That includes applying NLP/AI techniques to improve how these models interpret and reason over complex scientific literature. I am broadly interested in extending these techniques to assist scientific discoveries and support research innovation through AI models.
