## About

The Stony Brook NLP Reading Group meets regularly to discuss recent research papers in natural language processing and related fields. The reading group is intended for folks in the field and related fields to keep up with the latest work in NLP, grow in knowledge of particular domains, and practice critical thinking. Attendees with limited NLP knowledge are welcome, but the conversations typically assume a modest background in the field.
